# Week 01: Intro to The Course

This week we introduce the overall structure of the course and go through summary statistics for numerical data (mean, stddev, median, IQR).  We also cover an introduction to R and RStudio.

This week will be an introduction to the course topics & the R programming language.  If we have time we'll start discussing topics from OIS 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 & 2.1.

## Notes

Students filled out a google spreadsheet (anonymously) during class to answer the statistics "get to know you" prompts and then used google jamboards in breakout groups to visualize some summary datasets.
