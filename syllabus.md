# Syllabus - IS507AO: Data, Statistical Models and Information Spring 2021

## COVID-19 Statement
In keeping with University and iSchool policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of our community. If you are on campus, this includes wearing a facial covering properly, maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet from others at all times), disinfecting the immediate seating area, and using hand sanitizer.

If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to: testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, should contact their instructor immediately and cc their advisor.

Additionally, please be aware that there are mental health resources available to students:
 * https://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/​ 
 * https://mckinley.illinois.edu/medical-services/mental-health​
 * https://www.disability.illinois.edu/health/mental-health-resources​ 

### Impact on Assignments
Finally, due to the current messiness of the COVID learning environment, we are allowing up to ​three​ late homeworks. If you need to "use" one of your late homeworks email the instructor and/or the TA (if a TA is available for this class). You do not need to provide any explanation for why you’d like to use one of your late homeworks. You will then have until the end of the week --​ the Thursday after the homework was due, midnight ​-- to turn in this assignment.

## Course Description
An introduction to statistical and probabilistic models as they pertain to quantifying information, assessing information quality, and principled application of information to decision-making. The increasing prevalence of massive data sets and falling computational barriers have rendered statistical modeling an integral part of contemporary information management. With this in mind, this class prepares students to select and properly undertake commonly encountered modeling tasks. The course reviews relevant results from probability theory, emphasizing the merits and limitations of familiar probability distributions as vehicles for modeling information. Subsequent consideration includes parametric and non-parametric predictive models, as well as a discussion of extensions of these models for unsupervised learning. Throughout these discussions, the course focuses on model selection and gauging model quality. Applications of statistical and probabilistic models to tasks in information management (e.g. prediction, ranking, and data reduction) are emphasized.

## Learning Objectives
Students will demonstrate an understanding of probability theory and statistical learning by building and evaluating models of a diverse range of data sets. By the end of the course students will have basic concepts of what constitutes a “good” statistical question, what one can feasibly learn and predict with data, and an overview of toolsets and methods to answer elementary statistical questions. In particular, each student will be able to:
 * Articulate the role of marginal, joint, and conditional probability in modeling processes involving information.
 * Select, parameterize, and compare probability distributions as vehicles for modeling information.
 * Specify, estimate and evaluate elementary parametric statistical models.
 * Specify, estimate and evaluate elementary non-parametric statistical models.
 * Articulate professional responsibilities with respect to creating, describing and
using models built from data.

## Pre- and Co-requisite
IS430 (formally IS452) Foundations of Information Processing is strongly recommended as a prerequisite. A highly motivated student could pass this course without IS452 (so the prerequisite is not enforced), but programming will not be covered in this course. Students who have not completed an introductory course on statistics will need to come up to speed quickly on material covered early in the semester.
