# Syllabus - IS507AO: Data, Statistical Models and Information Spring 2021

## COVID-19 Statement
In keeping with University and iSchool policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of our community. If you are on campus, this includes wearing a facial covering properly, maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet from others at all times), disinfecting the immediate seating area, and using hand sanitizer.

If you feel ill or are unable to come to class or complete class assignments due to issues related to COVID-19, including but not limited to: testing positive yourself, feeling ill, caring for a family member with COVID-19, or having unexpected child-care obligations, should contact their instructor immediately and cc their advisor.

Additionally, please be aware that there are mental health resources available to students:
 * https://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/​ 
 * https://mckinley.illinois.edu/medical-services/mental-health​
 * https://www.disability.illinois.edu/health/mental-health-resources​ 

### Impact on Assignments
Finally, due to the current messiness of the COVID learning environment, we are allowing up to ​three​ late homeworks. If you need to "use" one of your late homeworks email the instructor and/or the TA (if a TA is available for this class). You do not need to provide any explanation for why you’d like to use one of your late homeworks. You will then have until the end of the week --​ the Thursday after the homework was due, midnight ​-- to turn in this assignment.

## Course Description
An introduction to statistical and probabilistic models as they pertain to quantifying information, assessing information quality, and principled application of information to decision-making. The increasing prevalence of massive data sets and falling computational barriers have rendered statistical modeling an integral part of contemporary information management. With this in mind, this class prepares students to select and properly undertake commonly encountered modeling tasks. The course reviews relevant results from probability theory, emphasizing the merits and limitations of familiar probability distributions as vehicles for modeling information. Subsequent consideration includes parametric and non-parametric predictive models, as well as a discussion of extensions of these models for unsupervised learning. Throughout these discussions, the course focuses on model selection and gauging model quality. Applications of statistical and probabilistic models to tasks in information management (e.g. prediction, ranking, and data reduction) are emphasized.

## Learning Objectives
Students will demonstrate an understanding of probability theory and statistical learning by building and evaluating models of a diverse range of data sets. By the end of the course students will have basic concepts of what constitutes a "good" statistical question, what one can feasibly learn and predict with data, and an overview of toolsets and methods to answer elementary statistical questions. In particular, each student will be able to:
 * Articulate the role of marginal, joint, and conditional probability in modeling processes involving information.
 * Select, parameterize, and compare probability distributions as vehicles for modeling information.
 * Specify, estimate and evaluate elementary parametric statistical models.
 * Specify, estimate and evaluate elementary non-parametric statistical models.
 * Articulate professional responsibilities with respect to creating, describing and
using models built from data.

## Pre- and Co-requisite
IS430 (formally IS452) Foundations of Information Processing is strongly recommended as a prerequisite. A highly motivated student could pass this course without IS452 (so the prerequisite is not enforced), but programming will not be covered in this course. Students who have not completed an introductory course on statistics will need to come up to speed quickly on material covered early in the semester.

They simply know the struggles of graduate and undergraduate-level writing and want to help you learn how to succeed and improve your writing skills. The iSchool writing consultants can help you with every step of the writing process. For detailed information on our services please visit our website: https://publish.illinois.edu/ischoolwritingresources/

## Land Acknowledgment
As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a responsibility to acknowledge the historical context in which it exists. In order to remind ourselves and our community, we will begin this event with the following statement. We are currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Peankashaw, Wea, Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community inclusive of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of our efforts.

[More information can be found on the Chancellor’s Website.](https://chancellor.illinois.edu/land_acknowledgement.html)

## Class Participation Policy
To be a leader in the fields of tech you need to be able to to clearly articulate issues and problems and how analytical tools can help. The way we foster this in the course is that you must participate in the classroom discussion. You are not required to "speak up" during every class session, but you do need to attend and contribute to the class and/or forum discussion over the semester.
Leaders are also expected to foster productive environments for those around them. Those in this class come from a variety of backgrounds and comfort levels with the material and programming - it is expected that all students (and instructor!) will remain cognizant of this fact at all times and any demeaning language or behavior will not be tolerated.

## Attendance Policy
This course is taught *synchronously* and as such enrollment in this course includes an expectation of regular attendance. If you find you must miss class, contact me as soon as possible. Students missing more than one class session or who regularly arrive late or leave early will not pass the class unless alternate arrangements have been made with the instructor. According to University policy: "For a graduate level course, attendance is expected, and should not be counted toward the final grade. The Student Code explicitly states that for all students, “(a) Regular class attendance is expected of all students at the University” (​http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part5_1-501.html​)

## Exam and Homework Policy
We will drop your lowest homework grade when we calculate your final grade. ​ All work must be your own, including all code turned in for assignments or exams. Using snippets of code or math tips can often be found online -- these are perfectly fine resources to use, but you MUST cite your sources.
All assignments and exams, including code and data, must be uploaded as files in Moodle. Your name should appear in the files and the file names as follows lastname-first-module.ext (e.g, naiman-jill-assignment1.pdf). The submission must include:
 1. A narrative document as a PDF file (to be read by a human). To preserve the natural flow of the narrative, figures (e.g., screenshots, code snippets) and tables should be embedded into the document near their first mention. Any supplementary files containing R programs or data should be referenced in the text and separately uploaded.
 2. All R code as separate files with an .R extension (to be read by a computer).
 3. And, when appropriate, a datafile needed to run the notebook file. 
 
 If coding is required for the assignment, you will not get full points if you do not submit the R file. If the code requires a dataset and this is not included in your submission you will not get full credit. Files should be uploaded individually, no *.zip files will be accepted.
 
 No late portions of the Project assignment will be accepted late.
 
## Academic Integrity
Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois, http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html, to which we subscribe. By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.

If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper acknowledgement must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty.

This includes if you find any solutions to homework assignments online.  If you do find an answer to a question online, you cannot simply copy the solution (even with proper citation) -- you must include an explanation, in your own words, about what this solution is telling you and why you think it is correct or incorrect.

If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!

Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and suspension or dismissal from the University.

Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are not limited to) creativity and the amount of original work demonstrated in the assignment. However, students are permitted to use and adapt the work of others, provided that the following guidelines are followed:
 * Use of other people’s material must not infringe the copyright of the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect to copyrighted material.
 * Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and author of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment. Summarize the changes or adaptations that have been made. Make plain how much of the assignment represents original work.

*This applies to code as well* – you are welcome to use online sources (e.g. StackOverflow) but be sure to include the URL in your code comments.

Additionally, unless explicitly stated **do not** publish homework solutions online.
