# IS507, Fall 2020 (taught online, synchronously; 2 hrs/class)

**NOTE: check each week to see if its IN-DEV or READY for each week**

These are the course materials for IS507 (previously IS542) at the iSchool, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  

If you see any bugs or errors please issue a PR -- always looking to make things better!


## How to use this repo

Each week consists of lecture slides and prep-notebooks in the programming language R along with suggested resources and readings.  The readings consist of what was "required" for the course as well as optional extra readings so feel free to take/leave what you'd like.

Below is the outline of the course, with links to the individual folders for each week.  Each folder contains:
 1. an "README.md" file which lists the suggested readings, datasets and any extra resources for the week
 1. The lecture slides (as a pdf)
 1. Prep coding notebooks used for the "live coding" portions of class which generally happened after the lecture portion (.ipynb files) **BUT** sometimes we swtich between the lecture slides & R.  This will be denoted in the slides as well as R.
 1. Any datasets used in the coding portion

## Reading

This course is based off of the following textbooks:

#### Required
   * [OIS]: OpenIntro Statistics, **4th Edition** which can be found on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OpenIntro-Statistics-Fourth-David-Diez/dp/1943450072) or in [free pdf form -- make sure you select "The Book" for free version](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics). 
   * [ITR] An Introduction to R, available as a [pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).
   * [ISL] An Introduction to Statistical Learning, click on the `Download the PDF` link [here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).
   
#### Optional
   * [MIS] [Intermediate Statistics with R](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/2999) ([pdf link](https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/2999/Greenwood_Book_2.1.pdf?sequence=9&isAllowed=y))
   * [STOR390] [STOR 390: Introduction to Data Science](https://idc9.github.io/stor390/) course page.


## Installation of R, RStudio and Jupyter notebooks

 1. Download R from the [R-project webpage](https://www.r-project.org/)
 1. Courses were taught using RStudio which you can [download right here](https://rstudio.com/)
 
**Totally optional:** To run the Jupyter notebooks with R locally, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and then please follow the [instructions for installing R using the Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/).  The easiest way to install packages is through the Anaconda GUI, or you can conda install -- either way you [need to append an `r-` to all packages!](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-r-language/)
 
 **NOTE:** There are pay-versions of this software but we assume you are using the free versions.

My background is in astrophysics (hydro simulations) so there will be an abundance of astronomy examples and space jokes.  Also my spelling is atrocious. You have been warned.
